Apacchii's Curated Classes is oficcialy supported by Apacchiis Classes Mod and serves as an addon/expansion to the original mod.

Apacchii's Curated Classes adds curated community made classes to the the mod called Apacchii's Classes Mod.

Currently adds: 1 Class.

If you're interested in making a class yourself this mod is open source, so you can extract the mod's content and see for yourself how the classes are made.
You then join the discord (mod's homepage) and ask me (Apacchii) if you can make a class.

You'll have to make the class yourself on a newly built mod and then send me the files so i can curate them and release them as part of this addon.
If needed i can provide additional example code files for you to look at, these are all commented and explain everything that you need to know when making a class.
Do keep in mind that the mod is fully open source, so by making a class you are agreeing to your code being open source too.

I wont take credit for anything the community makes, dont forget to name yourself in the class' tokens.
